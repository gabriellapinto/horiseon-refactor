# horiseon-refactor

## About this Challenge:
This project's goal was to change all of the div elements to more accessible elements such as "header, footer, nav, section," etc. By changing the div elements on this website, it makes it much easier for users to know what part of the website is which when using online accessiblity tools. I also fixed a link in the header so it now follows the correct directory. As well as this, I reorganized the CSS document so it now follows the CSS semantic structure.
